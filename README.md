#---------------------------------------
Hooks: useContext: Context is for passing down props essentially all the way down into any o fthe children without actually having to manually pass.
It's like a global state of all the child components
Instead of sending complext props into child use Context
Mainly used in module type components like (Article, Blog,etc..) to pass the parent state into child components.
